# Snomor

This application contains the 3 softwares at the core of our project.
For more information please refer to the different software's specific READMEs.

Here is an overview :

- Spec contains all the relevant specifications about the formats our solution uses
- Extract-OSM will help you extract data with these formats from OSM for usage with our solution
- Paths is the rust CLI to compute paths for vehicles given data in the specified format.

But we provided a script called "paths\_demo.sh" so you can launch it without reading every README for each software, although we strongly advise you to do so.
Be careful, to execute this script and launch the whole software, you need to have installed Rust, and at least the 1.47+/1.52+ version.

ENJOY !
